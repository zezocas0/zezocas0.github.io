Hello There ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Masters student in Robotics and Intelligent systems at the [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/pt/curso/467), currently working on my thesis on the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. 
Previously a Bachelor's student in Engineering and Industrial management in [Leiria's Politechic institute ](https://www.ipleiria.pt/en/course/undergraduate-in-industrial-engineering-and-management/), I've always been passionate about technology and its applications. 

Fell free to reach out to me even if you just want to chat. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges.

<!-- 
From programming, robotics, photography and biking, I try to experiment with a lot of things, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities.







Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
